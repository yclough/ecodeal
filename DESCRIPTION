Title: Functions for economic-ecological analyses of agricultural landscapes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yann Clough
Maintainer: Yann Clough <yann.clough@cec.lu.se>
Description: The functions in this package compute economic and ecological indicators for agricultural landscapes.
   The functions take rasters of the land-use crop-cover as inputs. Currently the functions are not general, but narrowly 
   programmed as support functions for modelling in the ECODEAL project (https://www.cec.lu.se/ecodeal), in collaboration
   with Stefan Kirchweger and Jochen Kantelhardt at BOKU Vienna.
