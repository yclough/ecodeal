# ecodeal
The functions in this package compute economic and ecological indicators for agricultural landscapes.
The functions take rasters of the land-use crop-cover as inputs. Currently the functions are not general, but narrowly 
programmed as support functions for modelling in the ECODEAL project (https://www.cec.lu.se/ecodeal).
